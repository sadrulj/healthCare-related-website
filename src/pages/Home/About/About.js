          MediCare+ was founded in January 2000 by a licensed Registered Nurse
          with the purpose of providing quality medical supplies to improve the
          lives of our customers and to support their personal independence.
          We've since expanded to offer health and wellness products as well. We
          now supply over 100,000 products from wound dressings to exercise
          equipment. We strive to provide those products that will add some
          vitality to your life. We work to keep our prices low so that when
          insurance won't cover it, we've got you covered. <br />
          <br />
          We're 100 percent committed to helping customers find quality products
          at an affordable rate. Our customer care team is here to help, whether
          it is to place an order or answer any questions. In addition, to help
          customers find what they need, we've also included informative
          articles on our website to answer commonly asked questions. <br />
